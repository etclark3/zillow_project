# About
- Using Linear Regession Models on Zillow data, attempt to accurately predict Single Family Home (SFH) prices for homes sold in 2017

# Summary:
- Seven features (bathrooms, bedrooms, bldg_quality, f_sqft, fips, lot_size, zip) derived from the Zillow data with originally 62 feature columns were the most accurate to predict the Tax Value (tax_value) of a SFH.

# Goals:

# Additional Improvements:
- Remove additional outliers and focus data on "normal homes" to increase accuracy of model predictions for homes for the 2nd and 3rd quartile of data
- Use census tract and block data as they define subdivision bounds. Homes values are typically similar in neighborhoods
